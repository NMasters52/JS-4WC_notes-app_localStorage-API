# Lunch Break Coding Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for a 4-week coding challenge I'm completing during my lunch breaks using only my iPad and GitHub Codespaces. The goal is to build various small web applications while improving my skills with limited time and resources.

## Week 1 Challenge: Local Storage Notes App

### Wednesday: Local Storage ✅
**Task:** Create a simple note-saving app that persists data.

**Implementation:**
- Created a browser-based notes application that saves content to localStorage
- Notes persist even when the browser is refreshed or closed
- Simple interface with a text area input and save functionality
- Notes list displays all previously saved content

**Technologies used:**
- HTML/CSS for the user interface
- JavaScript for functionality
- Browser's localStorage API for data persistence

**Key Learning Points:**
- Working with browser's localStorage API
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling

**Constraints:**
- Developed entirely on an iPad using GitHub Codespaces
- Limited to lunch break time (approximately 30-60 minutes per day)
- No external libraries or frameworks - pure vanilla JavaScript

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. Start creating and saving notes!

## Project Structure
```
/
├── index.html       # Main HTML file with the app structure
├── script.js        # JavaScript functionality
├── styles.css       # Basic styling
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Upcoming Challenges
Stay tuned for the rest of the 4-week challenge, where I'll be tackling different web development concepts during my lunch breaks!

## About This Challenge
This project is part of my commitment to continuous learning and improving my development skills, even with limited time. By restricting myself to lunch breaks and using only an iPad with Codespaces, I'm pushing myself to be more efficient and focused with my coding time.

Feel free to follow along with my progress or use any of these projects as starting points for your own learning!
